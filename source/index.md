The Snakemake Workflow Catalog aims to provide a regularly updated list of high-quality workflows that can be easily reused and adapted for various data analysis tasks. By leveraging the power of [**Snakemake**](https://snakemake.github.io/), these workflows promote:

::::{grid} 3
:::{grid-item-card} **Reproducibility**
Snakemake workflows produce consistent results, making it easier to share and validate scientific findings.

:::{grid-item-card} **Scalability**
Snakemake workflows can be executed on various environments, from local machines to clusters and clouds.

:::
:::{grid-item-card} **Modularity**
Snakemake workflows allow easy customization and extension, enabling users to adapt them to their needs.
